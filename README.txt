This app seamlessly integrates your blaQ garage door opener into the Homey ecosystem. With this integration, you can effortlessly control your garage door, monitor its status in real-time, and automate its operation using Homey Flows.

All control is handled locally through the blaQ's Local WebAPI, ensuring fast and secure operation. Real-time updates are provided using event monitoring, allowing you to stay informed about the status of your garage door without delays.

Note:Â For this integration to function properly, you need to configure your blaQ device to enable the Local WebAPI, with or without a password.
